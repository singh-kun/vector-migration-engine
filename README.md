# Vector Migration Engine (VME) ðŸš€

VME is an open-source tool designed to seamlessly transfer vector embeddings between different vector databases. It supports various databases like FAISS, ChromaDB, Qdrant, and Weaviate, ensuring efficient migration without data loss.

## Features

âœ… Supports FAISS, ChromaDB, Qdrant, Weaviate, and more.  
âœ… Preserves vector integrity and metadata.  
âœ… Simple API for easy migration.  
âœ… Parallel processing for fast transfers.  
âœ… Open-source and community-driven.  

## Installation

You can install VectorMigrator via pip:

```
pip install vector-migrator
```

## Usage

Migrate vectors from FAISS to Pinecone:

```
from vector_migrator import migrate

source_config = {"index_path": "faiss_index"}
destination_config = {"api_key": "your-pinecone-key", "index": "pinecone_index"}

migrate("faiss", "pinecone", source_config, destination_config)
```

## Supported Databases

VME supports multiple vector databases:

- FAISS
- ChromaDB
- Qdrant
- Weaviate
- More coming soon!
